# Callan's RESUME
# Hello, future employer, thank you for clicking :)
This is my resume repository, in which contains a few projects I am comfortable with sharing to showcase my knowledge and skills around data analysis

__EDA for HR dataset__
A small exploratory data analysis for a dataset with a practice HR dataset.

-Involves statistical programming

-Showcase of Python libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, seaborn.

-Involves report and education of many statistical concepts and reasoning.

-Involves basic visualisation.

__SQL 8 Week Challenge__
An 8 Week SQL challenge to showcase my SQL skills

-Involves a wide range of PostgreSQL functions and clauses such as UPDATE, SET, NULLIF, regexp_replace, type conversion (::NUMERIC, ::INTEGER, ::VARCHAR), to_timestamp, ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN, COALESCE, basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM), date and time functions (EXTRACT, date_trunc), and regular expressions ('^[0-9.]', '^[0-9]') for data modification, cleaning, and analysis purposes. 

-PDF format for ease of reading, instead of just code without context I used markdown to create presentable answers and the process behind them for improved clarity!


__Quantium Data Analysis__
Quantium is a data and technology company that have small, open-ended task-related projects around data analysis that anyone can try. It involves real world-based datasets with real products and is a perfect website to showcase some more Python skills while also sharing my results with the company itself.

- Involves large datasets manipulated using Python in a Jupyter notebook (in pdf format), answering open-ended questions concerning a theoretical stakeholder asking for information concerning a specific segmentation of customers.

- Use of wide variety of analysis function and statistical analysis libraries.
